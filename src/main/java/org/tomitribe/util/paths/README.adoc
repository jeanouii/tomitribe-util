= Strongly typed filesystem manipulation

Efforts to create strongly-typed code are often poisoned by string file path references spread all over the same codebase.

We constantly see code like this refering to file paths with strings.  This one has to have a typo in it.  Which is correct, `resource` or `resources`?

[source,java]
----
final File moduleDir = ...
final File srcMainResources = new File(moduleDir, "src/main/resources");
final File srcTestResources = new File(moduleDir, "src/test/resource");
----

What if you could have typo-proof, compile-time checked and code-completable paths like this?  Perhaps DSL-style approach to file paths, like so:

----
final File moduleDir = ...
final Module module = Dir.of(Module.class, moduleDir);
final File srcMainResources = module.src().main().resources();
final File srcTestResources = module.src().test().resources();
----

This utility was born out of a desire that all path references could be compile-time checked and code completed.

== Step 1 Create an interface matching a directory

For example, a directory structure like this:

[source,java]
----
 project/
   - src/
   - target/
   - .git/
   - pom.xml
----

Could be handled with the following interface:

[source,java]
----
 public interface Project {
     File src();
     File target();
     @Name(".git")
     File git();
     @Name("pom.xml")
     File pomXml();
 }
----

== Step 2 Get a proxied reference to that directory


[source,java]
----
import org.tomitribe.util.dir.Dir;

File mydir = new File("/some/path/to/a/project");
Project project = Dir.of(Project.class,  mydir);
----

Under the covers the interface is implemented as a dynamic proxy whose InvocationHandler is
 holding the actual File object.

== Returning Another Interface

Instead of `src()` returning a `Path`, it could return another similar interface. For example

[source,java]
----
 public interface Src {
     File main();
     File test();
 } 
----

And now we update `Project` so the `src()` method will return `Src`

[source,java]
----
 public interface Project {
     Src src();
     File target();
     @Name(".git")
     File git();
     @Name("pom.xml")
     File pomXml();
 } 
----

Now we have a strongly-typed directory structure that also supports code completion in the IDE.

== Passing a Subdirectory Name

There may be times when you don't know the exact subdirectory name, but you know that it will use a specific
 directory structure.  Here's how you might reference a nested Maven module structure:

[source,java]
----
 public interface Module {
     @Name("pom.xml")
     File pomXml();
     File src();
     File target();
     Module submodule(String name);
 } 
----


== `@Name` for indicating file names

By default file names are derived from the method name.  The following would indicate a directory or file named `src` under the module directory.

[source,java]
----
public interface Module {

    File src();
}
----

But what if you had a filename with a dot or other illegal java character for method name?  Just use `@Name` to indicate the expected file name:

[source,java]
----
public interface Module {
    File src();

    @Name("pom.xml")
    File pomXml();
}
----

This can also be useful for files that are otherwise hidden, such as `.gitignore`


[source,java]
----
public interface Module {
    File src();

    @Name("pom.xml")
    File pomXml();
    
    @Name(".gitignore")
    File gitignore();
}
----

== Listing Files

Let's imagine we have a Maven project structure with many submodules.  How do we list the `cheese` and `pepperoni` submodules?

----
pizza/
   pom.xml
   cheese/
      pom.xml
      src/
   pepperoni/
      pom.xml
      src/
   target/
----

=== Array of `File`

The simplest way is to return an array of `java.io.File` such as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Project {
    File[] modules();
}
----

This is close, but we haven't given any way for unwanted directories such as `target` to be filtered out.

=== `@Filter` Array of `File`

To get just `Path` instances that are directories and contain a `pom.xml` we can create a simple `FileFilter`, like so:

[source,java]
----
import java.io.FileFilter;

public static class HasPomXml implements FileFilter {
    @Override
    public boolean accept(final File pathname) {
        final File pom = new File(pathname, "pom.xml");
        return pom.exists();
    }
}
----

Then we can use it to filter out anything not accepted by our `HasPomXml` filter

[source,java]
----
import  org.tomitribe.util.dir.Filter;

public interface Project {

    @Filter(HasPomXml.class)
    File[] modules();
}
----

=== Array of `interface`

Of course, the main goal of the `Dir` utility is to elimnate `Path` references where possible.  So let's put our `Module` interface back like so:

[source,java]
----
public interface Project {

    @Filter(HasPomXml.class)
    Module[] modules();
}
----

[source,java]
----
public interface Module {

    @Name("pom.xml")
    File pomXml();

    Src src();
}
----

=== `Stream` of an `interface`

Arrays are fine, but often it's far more fun to use `java.util.stream.Stream`

[source,java]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public interface Project {
    @Filter(HasPomXml.class)
    Stream<Module> modules();
}
----

[source,java]
----
public interface Module {

    @Name("pom.xml")
    File pomXml();

    Src src();
}
----

=== `@Walk` to recursively `Stream` all matches

What if your Maven project structure is fairly deep and has modules inside modules?  By default, returning a `Stream` or array will only the matches immediately under the current directory, in our case the `Project` directory.

If we want to do a recursive walk by adding the `@Walk` annotation.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import org.tomitribe.util.dir.Filter;
import org.tomitribe.util.dir.Walk;

public interface Project {
    @Walk
    @Filter(HasPomXml.class)
    Stream<Module> modules();
}
----

NOTE: The `@Walk` only works when returning a `java.util.stream.Stream`

=== `@Walk` to recursively `Stream` matches N levels deep

Under the covers `java.nio.file.Files.walk` is used to traverse, filter each matching file, and return it as a `Stream`.  If happen to know your modules are not more than say 2 or 3 directories deep, you can specify a `maxDepth` to speed up the walk.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import org.tomitribe.util.dir.Filter;
import org.tomitribe.util.dir.Walk;

public interface Project {
    @Walk(maxDepth = 3)
    @Filter(HasPomXml.class)
    Stream<Module> modules();
}
----

== `@Mkdir` 

To force a directory to be created simply annotate it with `@Mkdir` as follows.  When the `target()` method is invoked a check will be done and the directory created lazily if it needed.

[source,java]
----
public interface Project {
    Src src();

    @Mkdir
    File target();

    @Name("pom.xml")
    File pomXml();
}
----

== `@Mkdirs`

The above `@Mkdir` instruction will still fail if the path leading up to `target` does not exist.  It's possible to create all parent directories via `@Mkdirs`

[source,java]
----
public interface Project {
    Src src();
}
----

[source,java]
----
public interface Src  {
    Section main();
    Section test();
}
----

[source,java]
----
public interface Section {
    @Mkdirs
    File java();

    @Mkdir
    File resources();
}
----

In this example if the path `src/main/java` would be created if we invoke code like this:

[source,java]
----
Project project = ...

final File srcMainJava = project.src().main().java();
----

Here we could safely write files into the `srcMainJava` reference as the directory and any parents would have been automatically created the moment `java()` was called.

NOTE: The path `src/test/java` would still not exist unless `project.src().test().java()` is also called.
